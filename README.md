# What to expect?

Look at these pages as the log book of an explorer, who discovers unknown territory. Magnificent views but also harsh environment. Like so many others, I wanted to give Blender a try, a few years ago. So, I downloaded the program, opened it and then after a few hours closed it, not to reopen it for several months. It was not that I wasn’t thrilled: looking at a floating 3D-cube that could actually move and rotate! How cool can it be? But then, came the reality check! May be I could …? Oh? That doesn’t seem to work! May I could …? Oh, oh! There was so much to know, so many buttons, and sliders, and checkboxes and whatever strange terms I’ve never heard of. Googling them made it worse: too simple, too macho, too old, too complex, too much. Blender has a steep learning curve. It’s easy to get discouraged.

Even now, after a few years of semi-intense use, I still run frequently into the old trap: “Oh, that doesn’t seem to hard; let’s do it with Blender”. And again, after many hours, I close the program with a few f-words.

This website will tell you the stories of these explorations into deep Blender Space. From coming up with a brilliant idea (at least in my mind) to the result. Sometimes quite successful, sometimes a miserable failure. It’s the story of trying, failing, understanding why and retrying. Of course, the part of understanding is the most important. It’s the only way to learn. I will go quite deep into Blender space to understand and to explain why things work (or not work) as they do.

Happy readings!
